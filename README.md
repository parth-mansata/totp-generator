# üîë TOTP Generator

**Description:**  
TOTP Generator is a self-hosted service that allows you to generate **Time-based One-Time Password (TOTP)** codes for any of your accounts. It comes with additional features like the ability to **edit or delete accounts**, customize account names and colors for easy identification, and ensure enhanced security by allowing you to hide or display the generated codes.

Just like popular password management tools (e.g., 1Password), you can **copy the generated TOTP code to the clipboard without viewing it**. The application is a web-based service that works seamlessly on both desktop and mobile devices, allowing you to manage your accounts from any device.

**üîí Security Features:**
- Secret strings are stored encrypted in the database to avoid leaks.
- Decryption is only possible with the backend application‚Äôs decryption key.
- User authentication is secured with JWT, using email/password-based login.

**üíª Multi-device Support:**  
Run the service locally on a single device or host it on a Node.js server for multi-device access.
